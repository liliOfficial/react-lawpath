### `Requirements`

1.  Create a ReactJS app based off the XD link below:
    https://xd.adobe.com/view/a77bf7fa-2534-4c16-bead-5cd288f0db35-f228/
2.  Data from the Next Steps section should come from the GraphQL endpoint.
3.  All other data can be mocked.
4.  For this tech test, buttons and links can all go to a default location of "/lawpath-test"

### `How to run the project`
#### `Git clone to local`

#### `Run npm install`

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `Further improvements`
1. Typescript: As the test focuses more on style styling rather than data transforming, I did not use Typescript for the project.Â 
2. Services layer: As only one section has a GraphQL API date, I have not structured an extra services layer for request.
3. Mock Data layer: Mock Data can be written in json files and put in individual data folders, so that they can be easily replaced by response data.
4. Unit test.
5. Full-responsive: The current page will not display well on small screen expecially for mobile. Further discussion is need to make it full-responsive.
